CSS3 Flexbox
------------

> Flexible boxes, or flexbox, is a new<sup>(<a id="rev1"></a>**[1](#1)**)</sup> layout mode in CSS3.
> 
> Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
> 
> For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents.

You could find more information on the [W3Schools][w3s], and on the [bible][w3c] site.
