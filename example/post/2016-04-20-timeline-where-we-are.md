summary: After some month of work (some hours only in reality), I would say : it works ! It's not the ugliest Timeline, you'll find (but it's not the prettiest).

## How it works ?

You just create your Baker post as previously. The Timeline is mainly the index that has been a little change.

## And internally ?

I wrote 2 css, one for the index and the other for the posts.

## Any one to thanks ?

Sure the original author of this css : [Dave Ruppert] [dave].

I found it on [codpen] [].
